		 *		and the other one will represent the position of the first biggest element (j).
		 *  		smallest element and another for the first biggest element.
		 * 		As we walk through the array, if we notice an element that is from the same group as the smallest ones,
		 *		we swap its position with the element at i+1 and update its position.
		 *		The same goes for the biggest ones, but in this case, we swap with the element at (j-1).
		 *		We will also repeat the same analysis for the same
		 * 		index once swapped, because we don't want to lose values that, for some
		 * 		reason may be at the former position of one of those variables.
		 * 		
		 * 		Once we are at the same position as the first element of the biggest,
		 * 		we won't need to worry about sorting anymore, it's already been sorted.
		 * 
		 * 		The complexity of this algorithm is O(n)
